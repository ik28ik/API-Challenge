This repo contains homework from the Python API lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.


## WeatherPy

This notebook creates a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
* This analysis will showcase the following:
	* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
	* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
	* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
	* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* For the analysis I randomly selected **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls, including a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Saveed the outcome results (CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot).
